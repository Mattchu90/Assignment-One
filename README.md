Hello and welcome to my profile. My name is Matthew Andrews. I was born in Australia, where all of my English-speaking family have lived for many generations. I grew up mostly in Brisbane, Queensland where I attended several different schools due to my father moving between jobs. Before taking this course with RMIT through Open Universities Australia, my highest level of education was grade 10 with Brisbane School of Distance Education. My distance education was due to the amount of hobbies I had when I was young. I rode horses, played drums, created electronic music on sound-cloud, skated and raced road bikes (pedal power)- which I still do to this day competitively.  

 

Interest in IT: 

 

When I was about 10, my father had an old IBM computer with a couple of games on it. You couldn’t just go to the start menu and select the game; you had to use command prompt and tell the computer to launch it. There were just two games; Prince of Persia and a flight simulator called TFX- which also had a real joystick. From this point on, I have always been partial to using hardware and software to play games or make music. My interest is very much a more “hands on, using” attitude.  

I came to RMIT to begin my journey in understanding how these technologies work. Why did I choose RMIT over going to a local campus such as QUT or Griffith? Because RMIT had online study options which fit well with my current lifestyle and responsibilities. I work full time and train for cycling after work, leaving just enough time to fit in a worthy study time. 

During my studies here, I hope to learn the different areas of what the field of IT has to offer. I expect to be taught about the different tools available, legalities and privacy, data storage and collection as well as networking and web development. As I learn these subjects, it will help me understand what sort of job appeals to me the most and assist me in becoming qualified for that field. 

 

Online occupational test results: 

 

Myers-Briggs Type Indicator:  ENFP- Extravert 53%, Intuitive 3%, Feeling 62%, Perceiving 25% 

Learning Style Test: Auditory 35%, Visual 55%, Tactile 10% 

Big Five Personality Test: Openness 87.5%, Conscientiousness 35%, Extraversion and Agreeableness 62.5%, Neuroticism 25% 

Looking at the higher percentage results here: extravert, visual and openness. For me these qualities are quite accurate. I’m talkative, outgoing and creative. I make friends easily and have a lot to say. My hobbies such as making electronic music or playing drums imply some level of creativity. As an ENFP personality working in a team, I would be very communicative with everyone and would have lots of idea as to how to tackle our tasks. My inspiration may faulter, when it comes to mundane details and work that restricts my creativity. However due to my higher level of agreeableness and feeling, I am unlikely to openly cause any conflict in a team as I try to avoid arguments and prefer to connect with people. 

 

Ideal Job:

Communications Technician 

My ideal job at this point in time is to become a Communications Technician. Specifically, in this case- one that does “FIFO” or fly in fly out work, with a roster of 7 days on 7 days off. The work carried out is the maintenance of communications infrastructure within the mining industry. I enjoy hands on work and lots of variations in the tasks required of me and I believe this job would be enjoyable. I would also like to have a week off after every week of hard work.  
This position; requires I work above and below ground, diagnose systems and conduct fault investigations providing corrective or preventative measures, develop and maintain communications and support engineers and fellow technicians. 
If I wanted to apply for this job, I would need to have experience in networking and have industrial experience. I require to have a history in a communication technician field. I must prove that I have an excellent understanding of radio networks and dianostics, an open cablers licence, communications trade qualifications, current working at heights and confined space accreditation and a current driver's license. 
Of these requirements, the only one I fulfill is that I have a current driver's license. 
I would rather apply for a position like this with high confidence in my ability to comfortably work as a communications technician. So I will continue my study in IT with the goal of completing a degree. I will also need the appropriate licenses and accreditation which I would also pursue. After I achieve my degree, I will attempt to find a job in a similar field as a technician to gain the relevant experience.  

 

Project Idea: 
 

My project idea is to utilise the Raspberry Pi’s on-board internet and Bluetooth connectivity to pair with a simple, specially made Android phone app, which will allow you to open and close your home garage door and adjust selected interior lighting- from anywhere. This sort of project is something I would enjoy doing. I love to see the results of my efforts; doors opening for me and lights turning on and off automatically would give me some level of gratification knowing that I had made it do that. It is not only practical but also has an element of coding and programming that would be useful experience for a future occupation. 
 
Stumbling through the dark and tripping over objects on the floor will be a thing of the past as you can switch on your lights from your phone. Sick of fumbling around with your keys to find the remote to open your garage door? Stress no more, as you can open your garage door with your phone. Maybe your guests have arrived early and you’re not yet home; you can open the door for them and allow them to make themselves at home before you arrive. If you don’t want to come home to a dark house after work, you can switch on your lights before you arrive to welcome you home. If you go on holidays and you like to leave lights on to make it look like someone is home to dissuade potential thieves, you can set a timer so the lights only come on at night to save electricity and money. 

My project is based on the idea of a Smart Home but will be much simpler. Smart lighting is the ability to control lighting in your home with a smart phone or tablet. Smart lighting has been created before, with companies such as IKEA, Apple, LifX to name a few, all providing Wi-Fi connected phone apps for Android and iPhone to control lighting. Some smart lighting apps also allow you to change the hue and saturation of colour that lights produce, but this requires special bulbs. Some companies give their apps an ‘away from home’ feature; so you’re able to control lighting no matter where you are. This is handy if you accidentally leave the lights on, or want the lights to be on for when you get home from work at night.  
Some smart lighting systems can be made to have motion sensors and “IFTTT” or If This Then That systems. For example, as you walk through the house, lights can flick on or off as you make your way. As described by Marshall (2017) from Techradar; “Fancy a flash of colour to notify you of an instant message, or a glow to gently break the news of today’s weather forecast? This and much more is possible without too much tinkering.”  
Apple uses the Home App or “HomeKit.” The app for HomeKit connects everything you could possibly think of in your home, to your phone. From audio-visual objects to climate control to locks and garage doors to security camera footage, HomeKit provides it all (Apple Inc. 2019). 
All of the HomeKit’s features, however, do come at a cost, with almost all of the options having a price of over $AUD100 each. Not everyone can afford luxuries such as this and this is where my project idea comes in.  
The price of a Raspberry Pi on Amazon is about $80. This includes the Pi, a power supply and wireless & Bluetooth software. The Pi is simple and easy to use and is a great tool to learn programming with (for example, Python or Scratch). For this project the Raspberry Pi will be connected via Bluetooth to your garage door and its simple task is to open and close the circuit remotely so the door will raise or lower. The Pi can also be connected to specific lighting in your home via Bluetooth, which will be controlled from the app too. This app will be useful to those people who want a cheaper, centralised remote to control some basic functions in their home. The garage door and lighting can be accessible as a group or individually. In the app, doors and lighting will be displayed under separate icons. Inside the door icon there will be an option to raise or lower the door. For the lighting, all connections can be displayed, with adjustability for each light or as a group. A timer feature can be utilised, which will also allow users to set times for when they wish the lamps to be turned on or switched off.  

I have no experience in programming and coding at all but those skills will be required to complete this project. I will need to learn how to create and program a simple phone app that has some of the features I described above. Connecting the app to the Bluetooth capability of the Raspberry Pi will be a challenge. On top of that, then being able to connect to that Raspberry Pi over the internet to control the Bluetooth connections from anywhere; will also be a huge challenge for someone with no experience. Another hurdle I foresee is implementing a Bluetooth circuit within the remote garage door motor. I am not qualified to be pulling apart circuits that are connected to my home's electricity supply so an electrician would be needed to install that part, if the project went ahead. The small range of the Bluetooth in the Pi may present an issue when trying to control lighting in the house and the electric motor in the garage. Where ever the Pi is, one object may be out of range.  

If all these issues are overcome, we will have developed a simple but exciting, more vanilla version of a Smart Home. In the future, more abilities could be added but still use the Raspberry Pi or even multiples, to increase the number of features that are accessible. I would also have developed skills in an area of IT that I find interesting and that would help me with future employment.
